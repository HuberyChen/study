<hr />
<h2><a name="New" id="New"></a>Software changes</h2>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR7.7</h3>
<h4>System changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 67109 -->The About page has been modified to remove the http.proxyUser and http.proxyPassword parameters from the Config File Overrides section.</li>
<li><!-- 67461 -->An issue with Tax Data Import, where taxpayer  jurisdiction registrations did not import consistently, has been resolved. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Retail Tax Extract (RTE) change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 67287 --> RTE now produces Send Sales records when a filter specifies a relative date range that encompasses one day. This change fixes an issue where RTE did not calculate sales data when a filter specified both the <b>Send Sales</b> option and an <b>Extract Data Between</b> date range of one day. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR7.6</h3>
<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 60755 --> Distribute tax transactions that force a tax on a freight amount are now supported. This change fixes an issue with Distribute Tax transactions, where a rounding difference  between the original single Invoice transaction and the corresponding multiple Distribute Tax transactions caused the Distribute Tax transactions to fail.  To force a tax in a Distribute Tax transaction on a freight amount of $0.00,  set the following parameters:</li>
<ul><li><span class="Code">tps.common.domain.force_distributetax_on_failure.supplies=true</span></li>
<li><span class="Code">tps.common.domain.force_distributetax_on_failure.procurement=true</span></li>
</ul>
<li> Invoice Verification events that invoke user-defined basis rules now correctly return sales tax. This change fixes an issue where these events were incorrectly returning consumer use tax after invoking user-defined basis rules.</li>
<li> Processing for Brazil transactions now  accommodates reduction of the Substitution Tax by a specified imposition and/or  a specified percentage. The following  two new configuration parameters support this change:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="Code">com.vertexinc.tps.common.domain.substitution.credit.imposition=xxx;y</span> (where xxx is the Imposition Type ID and Y is the ImpositionType source ID)</span></li>
<li><span class="Code">com.vertexinc.tps.common.domain.substitution.credit.reduction.flexfield=SUBCRED</span> (where SUBCRED should be replaced by the name of the numeric flex field that holds the ICMS credit  percentage)</li>
</ul>
<p>O  Series automatically deducts the Substitution Tax by 100% of the ICMS Reseller  Tax.  The new configuration parameters  provide flexibility by enabling you to deduct the Substitution Tax by an  additional imposition or by a specified percentage of the ICMS Reseller Tax or  other imposition.</p>
<p>With the <span class="Code">imposition</span> parameter, you can specify a Vertex-defined imposition or a user-defined imposition that will be deducted from the Substitution Tax, along with the ICMS Reseller Tax.</p>
<p>With the <span class="Code">flexfield</span> parameter, you can change the percentage of the ICMS Reseller tax or other imposition that is deducted from the initial Substitution Tax amount. To use this parameter, set up a numeric flexible field that specifies the percentage of the ICMS Reseller Tax that is subtracted from the Substitution Tax.  To apply the parameter to multiple jurisdictions, also set up a Lookup Table by NCM and Destination State to derive the ICMS credit reduction percentage, as well as a Tax Assist rule that populates the flexible field value with the ICMS credit percentage.</p>
<p>Depending  on your objective, use these parameters either individually or in combination,  as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To reduce the Substitution Tax by a specified percentage of the ICMS Reseller tax, use only the <span class="Code">flexfield</span> parameter.</li>
<li>To  reduce the Substitution Tax by 100% of both the ICMS Reseller tax and another  imposition, use only the <span class="Code">imposition</span>  parameter. </li>
<li>To  reduce the Substitution Tax by a specified percentage of both the ICMS Reseller  tax and another imposition, use both parameters.  (Note that this scenario could result in a double  deduction of the ICMS Reseller tax if both taxes are calculated for a given transaction.)</li>
</ul>
<li> Sales tax holiday rules in the U.S. state of Georgia can now be overridden correctly by user-defined rules.</li>
<li><!-- 65835 -->
   An issue with bracket tax calculation for the U.S. state of Maine, where O Series calculated an incorrect tax amount for a transaction having a basis rule and multiple line items, has been resolved.</li>
<li> An issue with U.S. state of Pennsylvania bracket tax calculations, where invoice tax amounts were inaccurate for transactions that included user-defined rules  apportioned by taxable amount, has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 66070 --> Effective rates in requests with multiple line items are now rounded to 6 decimal places.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Tax Extract (RTE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li> An issue with combined rate  bracket rules in the U.S. state of Virginia, where the Calculation Engine incorrectly applied an extra penny difference to state taxes for meals, has been resolved. O Series now correctly calculates and creates a bracket schedule for Virginia meals taxes.</li>
<li> An issue with RTE bracket schedules in the U.S. state of South Carolina has been resolved, and correct taxes are now applied for each bracket.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Retail Local Indirect Tax Engine (LITE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>All changes listed in the "Calculation Engine changes" section above also apply to Retail LITE deployments.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Miscellaneous change</h4>
<ol>
<li> An issue with Tomcat threads, where Tomcat became unavailable and  tax calculations for Brazil transactions failed, has been resolved.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR7.5</h3>
<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 64734 --> An issue with ARBillingSync transactions &#8211 where a transaction duplicated jurisdiction levels, returned different tax amounts in the XML response, and incorrectly returned Sales tax rather than Sellers Use tax &#8211 has been resolved. The ARBillingSync transactions now return the correct tax type for the jurisdiction level.</li>
<li> An issue that caused a null pointer exception (NPE) error when calculating value added tax in the Czech Republic has been resolved.</li>
<li> An issue with user-defined rules not overriding sales tax holiday rules in the U.S. state of Georgia has been resolved. A user-defined rule now correctly has precedence over a sales tax holiday rule.</li>
<li><!-- 65541 --> A line item tax effective rate is now calculated correctly when a Bracket tax is applied.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tax Setup changes</h4>
<ol>
<li> When you change the End Date in a Tax Assist Lookup Table, the new date persists after you save the change.</li>
<li> An issue with ESS Situs rules, where a business-to-customer transaction resulted in an error, has been resolved.</li>
</ol>
<h4>System change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 65044 --><!-- 66057 --> Performance when exporting and importing a large number of exemption certificates  has been improved.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Local Indirect Tax Engine (LITE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>All changes listed in the "Calculation Engine changes" section above also apply to Retail LITE deployments.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR7.4</h3>
<h4>System change</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <!-- 64024 -->An issue with Tax Data Export &#8211 where the export   failed because of certificate records that reference a URL for the certificate   image &#8211 has been resolved. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Calculation Engine change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 63321 -->
   An issue with taxability of freight in Canada has been resolved. When there is only one line item for apportioning freight (either a parent or only one peer), that line item is used as 100% of the apportionment, even if the weight or extended price is zero. 
<li><!-- 64458 -->
  An issue with multicomponent allocation &#8211 where a transaction showed zero tax when the taxIncludedIndicator was set to True &#8211 has been resolved.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tax Setup change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 64437 -->The Tax Assist administrativeOrigin.currency parameter now exports and imports properly.</li>

<li><!-- 63498 -->
  Taxability Drivers attached to  Exemption Certificates now display correctly when editing Exemption Certificates.</li>


</ol>
<h4>Retail Tax Extract (RTE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 64482 -->
   RTE logging of non-Vertex exceptions is improved. These exceptions now result in a status of &quot;Completed with failure&quot; and prevent the situation where RTE does not complete processing.</li>
<li><!-- 64748 -->
    The issue that caused a null pointer exception when processing max tax scenarios in conjunction with nontaxable rules has been resolved. RTE now uses the effective rule rather than the max tax rule in these scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR7.3</h3>

<h4>Installation change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 62023 -->The O Series  installer and Retail installer have been updated to correct a   failure that occurred when using a  Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that was installed in a directory that contained spaces (for example, C:\Program Files\Java). </li>
</ol>

<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 61096 -->A performance issue that occurred with Update 113 and  Tax Area ID lookup of European Union addresses  has been resolved. (Refer to &quot;Configuration parameter changes&quot; below for related parameters that are now obsolete.)</li>
<li><!-- 61641 -->An issue where Distribute Tax transactions failed for certain extended price and input total tax amounts has been resolved. These transactions now distribute the calculated taxes and round the results correctly.</li>
<li><!-- 61894 -->Accrual transactions and Invoice Verification transactions that require apportionment now process without error. This error was caused by incorrect swapping of the basis amount and tax rate and resulted in a message that the value was larger than the precision allowed for the field.</li>
<li><!-- 62162 -->The issue that caused a null pointer exception (NPE) error while synchronizing an invoice transaction has been resolved, and the synchronization request now modifies the transaction in the Tax Journal.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tax Setup changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 61102 -->Max Tax Rules now only fire when all qualifying conditions are met. This change fixes an issue introduced in 6.0 SR7, where a Max Tax Rule fired when only one of the qualifying conditions was met.</li>
<li>The issue that caused an error when deleting a user-defined imposition has been resolved.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Reporting changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 62740 -->An issue that occurred when creating a filter for the Data Extract Transaction Detail template &#8211 where the list of values for Taxpayer Company Code did not display &#8211 has been resolved. You can now select  from a list of values for Taxpayer Company Code when creating a filter for this template</li>
<li><!-- 62740 -->In the Data Extract Transaction Detail template, dates now display correctly.</li>
<li><!-- 62219 -->The following fields have been added to the VATDetail view in the Reporting Database:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Company Name</li>
  <li>Cost Center Code</li>
  <li>GL Account Code</li>
  <li>Output Notice 5</li>
  <li>Rate Classification</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h4>System change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 62846 -->An issue with Tax Journal Export, where an error occurred when a synchronization transaction was written to the Journal with an invalid currency unit, has been resolved.</li>
</ol>

<h4><!-- 62859 -->Batch Client Interface (BCI) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Two performance improvements have been made to the Batch Client Interface.
  <ul>
    <li>The maximum heap size has been increased from 1024 megabytes to 1280 megabytes.</li>
    <li>The limit on the number of threads when running BCI through Data Management has been removed. If running BCI as a database service, you can increase the thread count using the <span class="Code">batch.client.threadCount</span> parameter in the vertex.cfg file. If running BCI using a command line script, you can increase the thread count using the <span class="Code">-T</span> command line option on the <span class="Code">runBatchCalcClient.bat/.sh</span> script.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

  <li>The <span class="Code">batch.client.activityThreads</span> parameter has been removed from the vertex.cfg file. Thread count for instances that run BCI from Vertex Central is now controlled using the <span class="Code">batch.client.threadCount</span> parameter in the vertex.cfg file.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Client Utilities change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 63089 -->A new O Series Client Utilities script for the On-Demand environment  enables you to create a Data Extract report and download it to your local client location. Before running this script, you must  set up a Data Extract filter in O Series. To run the <span class="Code">runDataExtract</span> script, enter one of the following in the command line:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For Windows systems, type <span class="Code">runDataExtract.bat -u <i>userName</i> -p <i>password</i> -n <i>extractName</i>
      -l <i>localFileName</i></span></li>
    <li>For UNIX systems, type <span class="Code">runDataExtract.sh -u <i>userName</i> -p <i>password</i> -n <i>extractName</i> -l <i>localFileName</i></span></li>
    </ul>
    
    where all parameters are required and the  values are:
    <p></p>
    <table width="371" border="1">
        <tr>
          <th width="127" class="TableHeading" scope="col"><div align="center">Parameter</div></th>
          <th width="228" class="TableHeading" scope="col">Value </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><div align="left">userName</div></td>
          <td><div align="left">Your O Series user name</div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><div align="left">password</div></td>
          <td><div align="left">Your O Series password</div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><div align="left">extractName</div></td>
          <td><div align="left">The name of the Data Extract filter you created in O Series</div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><div align="left">localFileName</div></td>
          <td><div align="left">The name assigned to the downloaded Data Extract results file. The localFileName can be an absolute path.  If no path is specified the file is downloaded to the oseries-client-utilities/bin directory.</div></td>
        </tr>
        </table>
    
<p></ol>

<h4>Retail Tax Extract (RTE) change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 61790 -->RTE now consistently completes successfully when generating brackets. This change fixes the issue where RTE occasionally tried to generate duplicate brackets when it encountered a taxability change on the start date of the RTE execution's date range.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Local Indirect Tax Engine (LITE) change</h4>
<ol>
<li>All changes listed in the "Calculation Engine changes" section above also apply to Retail LITE deployments.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Configuration parameter changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>The following parameters in the vertex.cfg file are no longer valid. The VAT lookup cache is now always enabled.</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="Code">taxgis.jurisdictionfinder.VATLookupCache</span></li>
<li><span class="Code">taxgis.jurisdictionfinder.VATLookupCache_XXX</span></li>
</ul>
<li>The <span class="Code">batch.client.activityThreads</span> parameter has been removed from the vertex.cfg file. Thread count for instances that run BCI from Vertex Central is now controlled using the <span class="Code">batch.client.threadCount</span> parameter in the vertex.cfg file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Change in 6.0 SR7.2</h3>

<h4>Tax Setup change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 61102 -->A display issue with 6.0 SR7.1, where selected information was not visible in the Taxability Categories, Certificates, and Forms functions, has been resolved. The taxability category description now displays for the highlighted category in the Taxability Categories window and the Add Taxability Mapping window. Complete certificate and form information now display in the respective search results and details windows.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR7.1</h3>

<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 60545 -->An issue where the tps.common.domain.TpsJurisdictionFinderOptionsMaximumTaxAreas parameter did not override some TaxGIS configuration parameters has been resolved, and the override now works as intended.</li>
<li><!-- 60557 -->An issue with rounding in the Florida bracket tax calculation  has been resolved, and combined rate brackets and line item taxes are now calculated correctly.</li>
<li><!-- 60604 -->Transactions with a California destination address, but no physical origin address specified, now compute taxes without causing a null pointer exception error.</li>
</ol>

<h4>My Enterprise change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 60641 -->Certificates with user-defined Reason Codes now import properly, and the Reason Codes display on the certificates after import.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tax Setup changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 60929 -->An issue where an error occurred when attempting to  view taxability analysis or map to categories under the Manufacturing or Qualifying Conditions branches of the category tree has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 61368 -->The cache now refreshes automatically when changes are made to allocation tables. This change corrects an issue where the cache was not refreshed  after allocation table changes and bouncing the server was required to apply updates to the table.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Reporting change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 61629 -->The Data Extract Transaction Detail report now displays all line items, including those that do not include tax details.</li>
</ol>

<h4>System change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 61050 -->O Series users with the Master Administrator role can now run the Summary Data Update activity to update reporting summary data for all partitions.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Tax Extract (RTE) change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 60345 -->In RTE, when a business location has an address for an expired 9-digit postal code, the process  now attempts to find a valid tax area ID using the 5-digit postal code. This change corrects an error that occurred when attempting to edit a Taxpayer having a business location with an expired postal code.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Local Indirect Tax Engine (LITE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>All changes listed in the "Calculation Engine changes" section above also apply to Retail LITE deployments.</li>

<li><!-- 60861 -->The Tax Engine Extract status file  now includes the correct data update number  for deployments where data updates prior to version 100 have been loaded. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR7</h3>
<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
     
<li><!-- 53909 -->For O Series setups where some customers and/or vendors have the same codes as taxpayers, the Calculation Engine now uses only the taxpayer registration information to determine taxability. This resolves an issue where the Calculation Engine incorrectly used the customer or vendor registration information to determine taxability. </li>
<li><!-- 51106 --> An invoice-level, U.S. Max Tax tier rule  now processes correctly   when the first tier is nontaxable/exempt, the second tier is taxable, and the <b>Tax all at top level</b> option is turned off. The rate is now applied separately for each tier.</li>
<li><!-- 53833 -->Accrual transactions, in which both the parent line item and child line item have a vendor-charged tax, are no longer adding the child line item's tax to the parent line item's tax. </li>
<li><!-- 54002 -->An issue where imposition-specific exempt amount overrides were not processed has been resolved. If the amount associated with the override is 100 percent of the taxable basis, the tax is also completely exempt. If the amount associated with the override is partially taxable, then flat fees and quantity-based taxes fully apply.  </li>
<li><!-- 57757 --> An issue where a higher-level jurisdiction Basis rule overrode a lower-level jurisdiction Basis rule has been resolved. A higher-level jurisdiction Basis rule is now only applied   to a lower-level jurisdiction if the lower level does not have its own Basis   rule.  A user-defined lower-level rule  takes precedence over a Vertex-supplied lower-level rule.</li>
<li><!-- 50314 -->An issue where tax was not calculated correctly on a tax-inclusive line item having an embedded freight amount has been resolved. </li>
<li><!-- 50318 -->For an apportioned, tax-inclusive freight line item,  the derived extended amount plus the tax amount now match the input total price. </li>
<li><!-- 58679 -->In Distribute Tax  transactions, the Calculation Engine now correctly calculates the filing tax amount by multiplying  the input tax amount by the filing currency conversion rate. Previously, O  Series calculated the filing tax amount in the filing currency, but did not  include the input tax amount in the calculation. </li>
<li><!-- 55055 -->For transactions that involve filing currency conversion and an allocation rule, the issue that caused a null pointer exception error has been resolved. </li>
<li>The Calculation Engine now returns correct tax percentages and amounts for the U.S. state of Alabama sales tax holiday county-level rules that have conditional jurisdictions and defer to state-level tiered rules with taxable tiers that use the standard rate. </li>
<li><!-- 52866 -->An issue where nontaxable transactions with a price of $0 in the U.S. state of Texas were failing has been resolved. </li>
<li><!-- 51352 --> An issue where a nontaxable rule in the U.S. state of Iowa returned a taxable result for a $0 extended price has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 49463 -->To reduce the possibility of overcollecting Value-Added Tax (VAT) because of rounding, rounding adjustments are now made at the invoice level to account for tax-inclusive line items. </li>
<li><!-- 50305 -->The correct tax registrations are now returned consistently in the calculation response when both country-level input tax registrations and state-level input tax registrations are included in a calculation request. </li>
<li><!-- 53317 --> An issue for zero-rated, taxable, Intra-EU transactions, where there is no Buyer Registration ID in the output, has been resolved. For Intra-EU transactions where the TaxResultType is Taxable, the Output Notice specifies Intra-EU, Zero Rate, and No Tax Responsibility conclusions, and there is no Buyer Registration ID in the Destination country, the Calculation Engine sets the Buyer Registration ID to the first Customer Registration ID that it finds when searching alphabetically by EU country name.</li>
<li><!-- 58364 -->For Input Value-Added Tax (VAT) transactions where a taxpayer-level recoverable  percent is set up, the Calculation Engine now allows a transactional  recoverable percent override at the line item level. This logic applies both to  Purchase Order events where <strong>Calculate  Vendor Tax</strong> is selected and to Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS) events  where <strong>Calculate Self-Accrual</strong> is  selected. Previously, the recoverable percent was incorrectly set to 0 (zero)  in the XML response message when there was both a taxpayer-level recoverable percent  and a transaction-level recoverable percent in a Purchase Order event or ERS  event.  </li>  
<li><!-- 57035 --> Recoverable Percent values are now rounded to six decimal places.</li>      
<li><!-- 55472 -->Filing Currency Conversion Rates are now rounded to six decimal places.</li>
<li><!-- 58534 -->Transactions that include tax calculations from both the buyer and seller perspective are now rounding amounts correctly based on the currency unit for the transaction. For example, Purchase Order amounts that are reported in Hungarian currency (HUF) are now truncated to a  whole number. Previously, these amounts included decimal values. </li>
<li><!-- 55643 --> An issue with a leasing calculation involving more than one situs location, where a district tax was calculated based on the extended amount rather than asset cost, has been resolved. The calculation logic has been modified to apply the parent jurisdiction tax basis rule to all lower jurisdictions when there are multiple situs locations.</li>
<li><!-- 56181 --> An issue where the cost element was not returned in the XML response message when the cost was $0 has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 55549 --> The implementation of internal comparison functions has been corrected to prevent failures in Java 7.</li>
</ol>

<h4>My Enterprise changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 54069 --> Performance of letter batch processing has been improved.</li>
<li><!-- 47880 -->An issue where the <b>Validate</b> button had to be clicked twice to validate a certificate has been resolved. If a certificate number and format are valid for the specified jurisdiction, Exemption Certificate Manager now assigns a status of Valid to the certificate the first time you click <b>Validate</b>.</li>
<li><!-- 54337 -->An issue where a Taxpayer Location could not be deleted has been resolved. </li>
<li><!-- 58985 -->The system behavior when adding a business location to an existing Taxpayer &#8211 to set the Physical Presence indicator and force a state-wide override that assumes physical locations in every jurisdiction &#8211 has changed. After editing a Taxpayer to add a business location, the Physical Presence indicator no longer automatically applies on the state level. Physical presence is assumed only in  the  jurisdiction for the business location that was added for the Taxpayer.</li>
<li><!-- 50535 -->An issue when viewing registrations, where the filing currency for the first jurisdiction displayed as USD, has been resolved. </li>
<li><!-- 59305 -->O Series now supports certificate image files in Tagged Image File Format that have either a .TIF extension or a .TIFF extension. Previously, only files with the .TIFF extension were recognized.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Tax Setup changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 51095 -->To accommodate U.S. Max Tax scenarios that apply across multiple taxability categories, the setup for Calculation rules and Basis rules has been enhanced to allow selection of multiple taxability categories both from within the same branch of the taxability category tree as well as from different branches of the taxability category tree. (Previously, O Series required that taxability categories for Max Tax rules be selected from different branches of the taxability category tree.) </li>
<li><!-- 52948 --> When editing a user-defined imposition, the <b>Jurisdiction</b> box now reflects the specific jurisdictions for the <b>Include in Tax Base</b> and <b>Include in Imposition</b> parameters.</li>
<li><!-- 58276 -->When doing a Taxability Analysis in Procurement, date-based semi-automatic rules no longer display. </li>
<li>U.S. state of <!-- 55950 -->Tennessee county freight charges now inherit the apportionment rules that are applied at the state level. </li>
<li><!-- 56933 --> Based on the selected jurisdictions, the appropriate Canadian impositions are now available for the <b>Include in Tax Base</b> and <b>Include in Imposition</b> parameters when creating user-defined impositions and tax rules.</li>
  <li><!-- 52988 -->A Tax Assist rule that reads a participant-level item now references the value inherited from the invoice level, unless that value is overriden by the line item. This change affects Tax Assist rules for the seller, buyer, customer, and vendor participants. Participant-level items include company code, division code, department code, product class code, exemption certificate number, and   exemption certificate reason code. </li>
  <li><!-- 55690 -->An issue where a pre-calculation Tax Assist rule fired for a Purchase Order and then posted to the Journal, even though the conditions for the rule were not met, has been resolved. </li>
  <li><!-- 58398 -->An issue where Tax Assist rules incorrectly fired for transactions that calculate tax from both the buyer and seller perspectives has been resolved. </li>
  <li><!-- 58613 -->The administrativeOrigin.currency parameter is now available as an IF condition when building a Tax Assist rule.</li>
  <li><!-- 59178 -->Performance has improved when viewing Tax Assist rules with many conditions. This improvement resolves an issue where the screen became blank when attempting to view or edit a Tax Assist rule.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tools changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 52949 -->Transaction Tester now correctly displays basis rule information that applies to a transaction in the View Basis Rule window. </li>
<li><!-- 58297 -->The ESS Registration Number is now included with the line item tax in the Transaction Tester XML response message.</li>
<li><!-- 53926 -->An issue where Rate Lookup  showed rates inconsistent with those for the system date has been resolved. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Reporting changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 51048 -->In the Invoice Tax Detail Report, the Document Number field has been expanded to 35 characters.</li>
<li><!-- 49641 -->For transactions having multiple line items but different transaction dates, the Invoice Tax Detail Report now lists only the specific gross and tax amounts that pertain to each date. The previous behavior of listing the entire invoice gross and tax amounts for each date resulted in incorrect totals. </li>
<li><!-- 49939 -->The Sales Tax Holiday Report now correctly lists only taxability categories that are subject to tax holidays.</li>
<li><!-- 54660 -->An issue where the Taxability Mapping template in Data Extract reported expired conditional mapping rules has been resolved. Expired rules are no longer reported.</li>
<li><!-- 57185 -->The Start Date and End Date fields in the Certificates Data Extract template now correctly show the start and end dates for the Certificate record. Previously, these fields showed  dates for the jurisdiction Certificate Coverage records, which can change independently of the certificate start date and end date.  The template has been modified to include new fields for Coverage Start Date and Coverage End Date,  which  display effective dates for the jurisdiction Certificate Coverage records.  </li>
<li><!-- 57575 -->The Taxability Mapping template in Data Extract no longer creates duplicate records when reporting on non-conditional mappings. </li>
<li><!-- 59037 -->An issue with Data Extract, where  an intermittent error occurred when attempting to view a file after running a Data Extract report,   has been resolved.<br />
</li>
<li><!-- 54345 -->An issue where the VATDetail View in the Reporting Database contained an incorrect join to Flexible Field tables has been resolved. </li>
</ol>

<h4>System changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 55473 -->An issue where a Reporting Purge executed some queries multiple times has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 57810 -->An issue where a Tax Journal Export failed because of a tilde (~) in a certificate number has been resolved. The export no longer fails if it encounters a tilde in the Journal data.</li>
<li><!-- 52911 -->When viewing or editing a Tax Journal Purge filter, the value for the <b>Purge data posted prior to</b> option now correctly displays. </li>
<li><!-- 52278 -->An issue where Tax Data Import allowed duplicate business location codes to be imported has been resolved. If an import file contains duplicate codes, the Tax Data Import logs an error message to the report. </li>
<li><!-- 53466 -->An issue where vendor registration records in a Tax Data Export included Registration ID Code and Registration Type has been resolved. </li>
<li>An issue where a Tax Data Export resulted in errors and missing Taxpayer information has been resolved. This error occurred when one Taxpayer was selected for export in a system that had more than one Taxpayer. As part of the resolution for this issue, the <b>Taxpayer</b> field is no longer available on the Tax Data Export window for users with a Master Administrator role.</li>
<li><!-- 57748 -->For a user-defined rule applied to a jurisdiction below the state level, the Taxability Category now persists through the export process and the subsequent import to a different partition.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Miscellaneous change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 52063 -->An issue where users could not reset passwords and were locked out of the system after one unsuccessful login attempt has been resolved. Users can now attempt logins three times after an unsuccessful attempt before the system locks and requires administrator intervention. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Configuration parameter changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 50346 -->For an issue with apportionment where child line items of a nontaxable parent that is a service were  taxed, a configuration parameter has been added. This parameter, <span class="Code">com.vertexinc.tps.apportionment.Apportioner.includeServicesInApportionment</span>, specifies whether or not to include services in apportionment. The default value of <span class="Code">false</span> does not include services in apportionment, while a value of <span class="Code">true</span> includes services in apportionment calculations.</li>
<li><!-- 58872 -->Due to an error encountered when a BCI  transaction attempted to distribute tax for delivery fees for a nontaxable line  item, the <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.force_distributetax_on_failure.supplies</span> parameter has been modified. This parameter now applies to  apportionment transactions so that tax is distributed for apportioned amounts. </li>
<li><!-- 54719 -->An error that occurred when applying a Service Release patch, where back slashes (\) were being stripped from vertex.cfg parameter values, has been resolved.</li> 
</ol>

<h4>Supported platforms</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 53277 -->Vertex has added support for the Windows 8 operating system. </li>
<li><!-- 53276 -->Vertex has added support for Microsoft Server 2012. </li>
<li><!-- 56308 -->Vertex has added support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 10. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Web Services change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 55572 -->An issue that caused general Web Services interruptions and resulted in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsError being returned in the SOAP fault has been resolved. </li></ol>

<h4>Retail Local Indirect Tax Engine (LITE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>All changes listed in the "Calculation Engine changes" section above also apply to Retail LITE deployments.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Tax Extract (RTE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 53017 -->RTE now adds a warning in the Activity Log when no repeat pattern in penny tax differences is found while building a bracket schedule. In this situation, the RTE activity has the status <span class="Code">Completed with Warnings</span> and a Point of Service (POS) system cannot use the bracket schedule. </li>
<li><!-- 59155 -->An issue where RTE failed to generate a database because of multiple records for a business location code has been resolved. When multiple records for a business location code exist in an the database, fields from the record with the most recent Effective Date are  used in the extract.<br />
</li>
<li><!-- 53099 -->RTE now handles the European Union trade block jurisdictions. Trade block jurisdictions  use the value TRADE BLOCK for the DB field RTEJurisdiction.jurTypeSetName. </li>
<li><!-- 55738 -->To optimize RTE performance, certificate modification dates are no longer included as significant dates when RTE runs trial calculations during an extract. </li>
<li><!-- 51007 -->The Include Customer Data section of the Retail Tax Extract screen now works as expected. If both the <b>Customers</b> and <b>Customer Classes</b> check boxes are cleared, the RTECustomerExemption, RTECertificate, and RTECertificateClass tables are empty. </li>
<li><!-- 57984 -->For transactions with multiple impositions, the TaxGroupRule element now only includes the imposition that matches the related RTETaxRule record in the RTE database.</li>
<li><!-- 52434 -->An issue with combined rate  bracket rules, where the Calculation Engine incorrectly applied an extra penny difference to the U.S. state of Virginia state taxes for meals, has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 55061 -->For Canadian impositions that include a fee  in the taxable base for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Provincial Sales Tax (PST), an issue where Retail Tax Extract (RTE) sometimes incorrectly set the compound order number in the RTETaxRule table for impositions that should not have been included in the basis has been resolved. </li>
<li><!-- 57694 -->While  Certificate Number is not a required field for certificates in O Series, it is a required field in RTE. RTE has been modified to write the string value &quot;NULL&quot; to the certificateIdCode column in the RTECertificate table for certificates that do not specify a Certificate Number. Prior to this release, RTE failed  if a Certificate Number was not specified for a certificate.</li>
<li><!-- 57685 -->An issue with  RTE, where deleted certificates were incorrectly  written to the RTE database, has been resolved. </li>   
<li><!-- 52278 --> An issue where Tax Data Import allowed duplicate business location codes to be imported has been resolved. If an import file contains duplicate business location codes, Tax Data Import writes an error message to the Activity Log.</li>
<li><!-- 57516 -->An issue with the RTE Generate Database Export option, where amount fields (such as the tax amount) were not being written to the export file, has been resolved. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Batch Client Interface (BCI) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 50700, 51593 -->BCI performance has been improved by only initializing the Calculation Engine once when running multiple batches. </li>
<li><!-- 53132 -->BCI has been enhanced to improve performance for customers using multiple threads.</li>
<li><!-- 53021 -->BCI can now use the Business Location field to identify the destination address. (53021) </li>
<li><!-- 52596 -->BCI now sets Evaluated Receipts Settlement (ERS) transaction fields correctly, ensuring correct tax calculations. </li>
<li><!-- 56546 -->BCI now checks for the Customer Code,  Customer Class, or Customer Registration Number to set the customer registration information. </li>
<li><!-- 56544 -->BCI default values are now correctly set when BCI is run through the web service.  If any required fields are missing BCI returns a "completed with failure" message and logs a null pointer error. </li>
<li><!-- 57216 -->BCI has been modified to properly record certain types of exceptions, including Null Pointer Exceptions, when processing failed transactions. </li>

</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR6.5</h3>
<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 53942 -->An issue where imposition-specific exempt amount overrides were not processed has been resolved. If the amount associated with the override is 100 percent of the taxable basis, the tax is also completely exempt. If the amount associated with the override is partially taxable, then flat fees and quantity-based taxes fully apply.</li>

<li><!-- 57755 -->An issue where a higher-level jurisdiction basis rule overrode a lower-level jurisdiction basis rule has been resolved. A <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> higher-level jurisdiction basis rule is now only applied   to a lower-level jurisdiction if the lower level does not have its own basis   rule.  A user-defined lower-level rule  takes precedence over a Vertex-supplied lower-level rule. </span></li>
</ol>

<h4>Data Extract change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 57460 -->The Start Date and End Date fields in the Certificates Data Extract template now correctly show the start and end dates for the Certificate record, rather than dates for the jurisdiction Certificate Coverage records, which can change independently of the certificate start date and end date.  The template has been modified to include new fields for Coverage Start Date and Coverage End Date,  which  display effective dates for the jurisdiction Certificate Coverage records.  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Batch Client Interface (BCI) change</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 57215 -->BCI has been modified to properly record certain types of exceptions, including Null Pointer Exceptions, when processing failed transactions.  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Local Indirect Tax Engine (LITE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>All changes listed in the "Calculation Engine changes" section above also apply to Retail LITE deployments.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Retail Tax Extract (RTE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 57229 -->An issue with the RTE Generate Database Export option, where amount fields (such as the tax amount) were not being written to the export file, has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 57232 -->An issue with  RTE, where deleted certificates were incorrectly  written to the RTE database, has been resolved.</li>
<li><!-- 56793 -->While  Certificate Number is not a required field for certificates in O Series, it is a required field in RTE. RTE has been modified to write the string value &quot;NULL&quot; to the certificateIdCode column in the RTECertificate table for certificates that do not specify a Certificate Number. Prior to this release, RTE failed  if a Certificate Number was not specified for a certificate.  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR6.4</h3>
<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Tennessee county freight charges now inherit the apportionment rules that are applied at the state level.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reporting change</h4>
<ol>
<li> The Certificates template in Data Extract now shows the correct value for the Reason Code field.</li>
<li><!-- 54335 -->An issue where a Reporting purge executed some queries multiple times has been resolved.</li></ol>
<h4>Retail Local Indirect Tax Engine (LITE) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li>All changes listed in the "Calculation Engine changes" section above also apply to Retail LITE deployments.</li></ol>
<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR6.3</h3>
<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <!-- 54963 -->
    An issue where the taxpayer for a transaction was incorrectly identified has been resolved. This issue occurred when there were different Taxpayer codes defined on the line item than on the transaction. For example, an initially invalid transaction-level Taxpayer was corrected on the line item level using a Tax Assist rule.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <!-- 54939 -->
    For transactions that involve filing currency conversion and an allocation rule, the issue that caused a null pointer exception error has been resolved.</li>
</ol>
<h4>RTE change</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <!-- 55052 -->
    For Canadian impositions that include a fee  in the taxable base for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Provincial Sales Tax (PST), an issue where Retail Tax Extract (RTE) sometimes incorrectly set the compound order number in the RTETaxRule table for impositions that should not have been included in the basis has been resolved. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR6.2</h3>
<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <!-- 54353 -->
    An issue with the Federal Medical Devices Excise Tax  &#8211 where a NO_TAX result is returned for all U.S. transactions for which the Taxpayer is not registered in the U.S. &#8211 has been resolved, and the expected tax result is returned. The Federal Medical Devices Excise Tax  goes into effect on January 1, 2013. If the 6.0 SR6.3 patch is not applied, O Series clients can register their Taxpayers in the U.S. to prevent the NO_TAX result from being returned. </li>
  <li>
    <!-- 50964 -->
    Accrual transactions, in which both the parent line and child line  have a vendor-charged tax at the line-item level, are no longer adding the child line item's tax to   the parent line item's tax twice, which resulted in an over application of tax. </li>
  <li>When looking up taxpayer registration information, the Calculation Engine now looks only at taxpayer records. Previously, it also looked at customer and vendor records, creating a situation where it incorrectly used a customer or vendor record to determine taxability, <i>if</i> that customer or vendor had the same code as the taxpayer. 
    <!-- 53911 -->
   The Calculation Engine now uses only the taxpayer registration information to determine taxability.</li>
</ol>
<h4>My Enterprise change</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <!-- 54335 -->
    An issue where an incorrect Taxpayer location was deleted when the vertical scroll position was not at the top of the grid has been resolved. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Tax Assist change</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A Tax Assist rule that looks for a participant-level item, such as a buyer's customer code, now references the value   at the transaction level, unless that value is overriden on the line-item level. Previously, when looking for the participant-level item, the Calculation Engine pulled the value from the line item before checking for a transaction-level value.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Batch Client Interface (BCI) change</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <!-- 52539 -->
    Batch Client Interface (BCI) now correctly sets transaction participant fields when processing ERS transactions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR6.1</h3>

<h4>Calculation Engine changes</h4><ol>
<li><!-- 50254 -->An issue where tax was not calculated correctly on a tax-inclusive line item having an embedded freight amount has been resolved. When  a parent line item is tax-inclusive and has a child line item for freight, the tax is now calculated only on the freight. </li>
<li><!-- 50256 -->An issue with an apportioned, tax-inclusive freight line item,  where the derived extended amount plus the tax amount did not match the input total price has been resolved. The extended amount plus the tax amount now match the input total price in these instances.</li>
<li><!-- 50631 -->The calculation that resolves imposition interdependencies in Brazil now terminates after a  set number of iterations and returns a message. The configuration parameter that defines the maximum number of iterations is <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.Situs.situsLoopExceptionCount</span>. The default is 1,000 iterations.</li>
<li><!-- 40370 -->Rounding of tax rates in Tax Rules lookup now correctly rounds off the rate to the hundredths place. For example, a rate that displayed at 3.8499999999999996% now displays as 3.85%.</li>
<li><!-- 50304 -->The correct tax registrations are now returned consistently in the calculation response when both country-level input tax registrations and state-level input tax registrations are included in a calculation request. </li>
<li><!-- 52867 -->An issue where nontaxable transactions with a price of $0 in Texas were failing has been resolved. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Batch Client Interface (BCI) changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 51565 -->An issue where the status for transactions in all batches was incorrectly set to Processing in the batch control table has been resolved. (Only transactions in batches with a status of Ready were actually processed.)</li>
<li>BCI performance when processing a large number of batches has been improved by not restarting the Calculation Engine for each batch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Certificate Management changes</h4>
<ol>
<li><!-- 49456 -->An issue with migrating exemption certificates with a large number of images (that would have resulted in a ZIP file larger than 4 GB) from  ECM 3.2 to ECM 6.0 in a 32-bit environment has been resolved.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR6</h3>

 <li><!-- 33889 -->Vertex O Series now supports database compression for Oracle and SQL Server.</li>



</ol>
<h4>Configuration parameter changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li><!-- 41937 -->A new configuration parameter,    <span class="Code">com.vertexinc.tps.xml.IncludeResponseTime</span>,	lets you know how much time the Calculation Engine spent on a calculation request. The elapsed calculation time is returned in the XML response to a calculation request. Set this parameter to <span class="Code">True</span> to return the calculation time.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 34866 -->The maximum number of database connections set using the <span class="Code">maxconnections</span>  parameter  is now strictly enforced.</li>

  <li><!-- 33850 -->A new configuration parameter, <span class="style4">com.vertexinc.tps.common.domain.dpp.exempt</span>, when set to <span class="style4">True</span>, causes Invoice Request transactions using a direct pay permit certificate to correctly include the gross amount and report them as exempt on sales tax returns.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 35848 -->A new configuration parameter, <span class="Code">com.vertexinc.tps.common.importexport.domain.certificateImage.zip.nodirectory</span>, enables you to import certificates to O Series in a directory and subdirectory structure defined in the import file. This parameter helps to expedite the import process when you are importing a large number of certificate image files.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 36746 -->A new configuration parameter, <span class="Code"> tps.common.domain.implyMainDivisionRegistrationWithTaxRegistrationOverrides</span>, directs the Calculation Engine to assume that all lower-level jurisdictions within a given country-level registration are either registered (<span class="Code">True</span>) or not registered (<span class="Code">False</span>).</li>
  
  <li><!-- 37446 -->Two new configuration parameters, <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.force_distributetax_on_failure.supplies</span> and <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.force_distributetax_on_failure.procurement</span>, control whether or not a Distribute Tax transaction is forced on an Input Total Tax amount when the transaction is actually nontaxable.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 38243 -->A new configuration parameter, <span class="Code">common.reports.dir.extCertImageFileLocation</span>, identifies the directory for certificates that are located outside of the O Series directory structure.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 38957 -->A new configuration parameter, <span class="Code">com.vertexinc.tps.common.persist.tj.extendedPrice</span>, specifies for a Distribute Tax transaction whether the passed-in extended price of $0 or the calculated extended price  is recorded in the Tax Journal.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 39288 -->An option has been added to the <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.TpsJurisdictionFinderOptionsAlternativeRegionTypeLists_XXX</span> parameter to apply an alternative region type list to all countries.</li>
</ol>
  
<h4>Tax Setup changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li><!-- 43348 -->An issue where a search for Tax Rule summaries returned no results has been resolved.</li>


  <li><!-- 17697 -->An issue where the Tax Rules part of Tax Setup would not permit the creation of tax rules with multiple jurisdictions with a taxable conclusion has been resolved.</li>


  <li><!-- 42870 -->
  An issue where setting an end date  on a Taxpayer Business Location created a new Business Location with an end date before its start date, causing Taxability Manager exports with Business Locations to fail, has been resolved.</li>
  
    
  <li><!-- 33006 -->O Series now displays a warning and prevents a user from building a tax rule using two tax drivers of the same type.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 40060 -->For situs rules, O Series now allows only a single jurisdiction to be selected per address type.</li>
 
  <li><!-- 42298 -->When mapping a taxability driver to a category, all applicable conditional rules having a single taxability category are now displayed and available for selection.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 39866 -->The Taxability Mapping function has been enhanced to show if a mapping already exists for an entity and enable you to filter entities out of the listing that have already been mapped to a Taxability Category.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 44080 -->An issue where users were permitted to create duplicate Taxpayers (having the same name and code but with different internal keys) has been resolved.</li>


  <li><!-- 41777 -->
  Users can now create taxpayers for a Procurement Business Event with Invoice Verification thresholds set to zero.  Users can now also remove Invoice Verification thresholds after they are set.</li>



  <li><!-- 46694 -->When searching in Tax Rules for Impositions, each imposition type is now displayed only once.</li>
</ol>
<h4>My Enterprise changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li><!-- 41054 -->VIES Validation has been expanded to validate vendor VAT registration numbers, as well as customer VAT registration numbers.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Retail changes</h4>

<ol>
  <li><!-- 44151 -->The Vertex Retail Tax Extract utility now properly determines the county tax for the U.S. Tennessee state tax is divided into two separate impositions (in support of TN tax holiday processing). The ordering of the separate Tennessee State taxes has been corrected so that the primary tax is first and the single article surcharge is second.</li>
  
  <li><!-- 35628 -->When a BusinessLocation is edited and saved the country of the BusinessLocation is populated in both the database BusinessLocation table and the extract.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tax Data Import changes

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR5.3</h3>

<p class="Caution"><strong>Support Notice – O Series version 6.0 SR5.3<br />
  Dear Vertex Subscriber,<br />
  Vertex has identified a critical issue related to moving records from the Tax Journal database to the Reporting database which could result in data corruption.  This issue impacts only high volume customers who have processed approximately 1 billion line items.  Please plan on patching up to at least 6.0 SR5.3 on the SR5 baseline or to 6.0 SR6 which will be released shortly.<br />
  <br />
  Moving to 6.0 SR5.3 does not require data migration and can be accomplished as a patch process.  Customers using Vertex Partner or Custom integrations may continue to use the installed integration.  As a best practice Vertex recommends that a test cycle is completed prior to promoting the latest service release or maintenance pack to a production system.<br />
  <br />
  Vertex truly appreciates your business.  If you have any questions, please contact us at 800.281.1900 and select Product Code 4765, or visit myVertex to submit a support inquiry at https://my.vertexinc.com/home</strong><br />

The option is provided by a configuration parameter,<span class="Code"> taxgis.jurisdictionfinder.ToApproximateTaxAreasHistorically</span>. Setting this parameter to <span class="Code">TRUE</span> causes the system to use the jurisdiction information in the new tax area to try to determine the appropriate tax area that would have been used in the past.

          </ul>
        </li>
      
        <li><!-- 35917 -->The Calculation Engine has been modified to permit the distribution of the total amount of tax on a transaction to just the city level, and not the state, county, or district levels.</li>
        <li><!-- 34667 -->An issue where freight tax calculation on a distribute tax request resulted in tax being incorrectly distributed among line items has been resolved.</li>

        <li><!-- 33912 -->The Calculation Engine no longer evaluates the form expiration date to determine if an Exemption Certificate is still valid, preventing Certificates still within their effective date range from being considered expired.</li>
     
        <li><!-- 39961 -->An issue where transactions that included addresses not registered to a Taxpayer or Vendor failed, has been resolved.</li>

        <li><!-- 39749 -->Transactions that apportion freight and also contain a line item with a Deferred Tax Result now correctly treat the freight basis apportioned to the Deferred line item as nontaxable.</li>

      </ol>

<h4>VIES Validation changes</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><!-- 32073 -->Customers who have licensed the EMEA region should note that, when attempting to perform VIES validation, the country code prefix for Greece is EL, and the country code prefix for Austria is ATU. These are different from the ISO Country Codes for Greece and Austria. If a certificate has the ISO Country Code for Greece or Austria as its prefix, it will not be recognized as an EU country and will not be processed by VIES Validation.</li>
        
        <li><!-- 33072 -->The VIES Validation process now incorporates more descriptive error reporting, instead of simply reporting timeout errors.</li>
      </ol>

<li><!-- 29865 -->The following fields can now be set in pre-calculation  Tax Assist rules:
          <ul>
            <li class="Code style4">inputTaxLocation.city</li>

<li><!-- 31750 -->Tax Assist now includes parameters allowing you to create tax rules that specify an action performed if a customer, buyer, seller, or vendor is registered in a particular country. When one or more of these parameters are used in a Tax Assist expression, O Series cycles through each of the tax registrations passed on the transaction  to find a match of the value. These parameters have no default value.
<ul>
          <li class="Code style4">buyer.anytaxRegistration.isoCountryCode</li>
          <li class="Code style4"> buyer.anytaxRegistration.mainDivision</li>

          <li class="Code style4"> vendor.anytaxRegistration.mainDivision</li>
        </ul>
</li>

<li><!-- 32368 --><span class="Code">Null</span> is now an acceptable value for the <span class="Code">customer.taxregistration.isocountycode</span> Tax Assist parameter.</li>

<li><!-- 30005 -->The Imposition Name can now be set in pre-calculation Tax Assist and viewed in post-calculation Tax Assist tax rules.</li>

<ol>
          <li><!-- 35712 -->Additional taxes incurred when apportionment of freight charges caused a line item to lose eligibility for a sales tax holiday are now distributed appropriately between the primary line item and the freight line item. For the state of Connecticut, freight charges no longer cause a change in eligibility for the holiday.</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR4</h3>
<p class="Caution"><strong><!--28553-->Announcement for current users of IBM iSeries (AS/400)</strong><br>
    <br>Vertex has not formally tested and verified IBM i5/OS V7R1 with O Series. However, Vertex will provide support for V7R1 for O Series 5.0 and 6.0 users who were live with O Series on i5/OS prior to May 2011 and upgrade to V7R1.<br>
<br>Vertex will retire support for the IBM iSeries (AS400) hardware and the IBM i5/OS (OS/400) operating system with O Series 7.0.</p>
    
    <h4>Supported platforms</h4>
    <ol><li>
      <!-- 28530 -->
Vertex has added support for the Apache Tomcat 7 application server.</li>
      </ol>
    
<h4>New Configuration parameters</h4>
<ol>
      <li>
        <!-- 28883 -->
        O Series now includes a configuration parameter, <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.ImputedTaxCalculator.taxIncludeRoundUpTax</span>, that improves the accuracy of Tax Inclusive Price calculations. This parameter allows you to configure whether to round up or round down the Basis Amount by a fraction of one cent to arrive at the correct Tax Inclusive Price amount.</li>
      <li>
        <!-- 31914 -->
      O series now includes a configuration parameter, <span class="Code">taxjournal.SkipTransactionRow</span>, that controls whether the Calculation Engine writes separate transaction-level rows to the Tax Journal during transaction processing. These transaction-level details are required if you use Modify Synchronization messages to change transaction data after it has been initially posted to the Tax Journal. You can set this parameter only if you do <em>not</em> use Modify Synchronization messages.
      <p> If you set this parameter to True, the Calculation Engine does not write transaction-level data to the Tax Journal. When you omit this processing step, O Series performance may be improved.
      Otherwise, the default value (False) for this parameter directs O Series to write transaction-level data to the Tax Journal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <!--  32038 -->
        O Series now includes two configuration parameters that turn off the Report Summary table and Flex Field processing that occurs during Tax Journal Export.<br />
        <br />
        The <span class="Code">taxjournalexport.BuildReportSummary</span> parameter turns off Report Summary processing during Tax Journal Export. If you set this parameter to False, Data Management does not process the Report Summary table during Tax Journal Export. When you omit this processing step, O Series performance may be improved. Otherwise, the default value (True) for this parameter directs Data Management to process the Report Summary table during Tax Journal Export.<br />
        <br />
        The <span class="Code">taxjournalexport.ExportFlexFields</span> parameter turns off Flex Fields processing during Tax Journal Export. If you set this parameter to False, Data Management does not process the Flex Fields during Tax Journal Export. When you omit this processing step, O Series performance may be improved. Otherwise, the default value (True) for this parameter directs the Data Management to process Flex Fields during Tax Journal Export.</li>
      <li><!-- 18279 -->O Series now includes a configuration parameter to allow users to reduce the extended price of an item when tax is computed on cost. If the parameter, <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.limitTaxInclusiveToExtendedPrice</span>, is set to True, and a line item is identified as taxIncluded=true, the Calculation Engine identifies only the ExtendedPrice basis amount (whether directly supplied or derived from the quantity and unit price) as tax inclusive. The default value is False.</li>
      <li><!-- 18279 -->O Series now includes a configuration parameter, <span class="Code">com.vertex.rba.loginRetryLimi</span>t, that allows you to set the number of invalid password attempts O Series accepts.</li>
      <li><!-- 17601, 17602 -->O Series now includes several new configuration parameters that allow you more control of the Address Cleansing process:
        <ul>
          <li> <span class="Code">taxgis.jurisdictionfinder.ContinueIfAddressFailsToCleanse</span></li>
          <li><span class="Code"> tps.common.domain.TpsJurisdictionFinderOptions.ContinueIfAddressFailsToCleanse</span></li>
          <li><span class="Code">taxgis.jurisdictionfinder.ToUseAddressCleansingDPV</span></li>
          <li class="CodeVariable"> <span class="Code">tps.common.domain.TpsJurisdictionFinderOptions.ToUseAddressCleansingDPV</span></li>
          <li class="Code"> <span class="Code">taxgis.jurisdictionfinder.ToRetrieveAddressCleansingSecondStreetLine</span></li>
          <li class="Code"><span class="Code"> tps.common.domain.TpsJurisdictionFinderOptions.ToRetrieveAddressCleansingSecondStreetLine</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can set these parameters through Vertex Central  in  Tools &gt; Tax Area Lookup&gt; By Address  in the Tax Area ID Lookup Options window as well as in the <span class="Code">vertex.cfg</span> file. Refer to the Configuration File Parameters Reference Guide for more information.</p>
      </li>
    
</ol>
<h4>Calculation Engine Changes</h4>

      <!-- 17270 -->
      An issue where there were no taxes to which an input tax could be distributed has been resolved.</li>
    <li>
      <!-- 29160 -->
      An issue where a nontaxable parent line item with apportioned child line items was incorrectly showing the child line items as taxable when the parent extended amount was negative, has been resolved.</li>
    <li>
      <!-- 30628 -->
      The Calculation Engine was updated to correct an issue in which a distributed tax calculation with an input tax amount and no jurisdiction type was returning incorrect results.</li>
    <li>
      <!-- 17269 -->
      An issue where the calculation of tax for the category Consumable Supplies Sold Without Prescription had failed, has been resolved.</li>

    <ol>
        <li><!-- 27767 -->Users can now select additional jurisdictions and additional imposition types from the Select Tax Imposition screen, as was the case in earlier version of Indirect Tax O Series. Only jurisdictions that intersect with the jurisdiction originally selected when the imposition was created may be added. </li>
        
        <li><!--  27788 -->The Task Log Detail screen for the TDM Certificate Export to the Vertex Q Series Tax Decision Maker now includes a verified link to the exported output file. This link enables you to display the exported TDM Certificate data.</li>
            
        <li><!--  31746 -->The Reporting Purge screen has been revised to purge records posted before the present date (Today).  It had previously been purging records posted up to and including the present date.  Since the purge is based on the date a record is posted, rather than on the date a record is exported, the phrase "Purge data exported prior to:" has been changed to "Purge data posted prior to:". </li>
        
        <li><!--  16969 -->Usernames can now, in all instances within O Series, be up to 64 characters long.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>
          <!-- 28341 -->
          A Rate Lookup inquiry and the report generated by the inquiry now show results to the same level of precision, three digits after the decimal place.     </li>
        <li>
          <!--  17231 -->
          The "|" (pipe) character is now supported by Tax Assist for the EDIT ME field.</li>

<h4>Retail Changes</h4>
<ol>
      <li>For Vertex Indirect Tax for Retail customers who use the Retail Tax Extract (RTE) deployment:
        <ul>
          <li><!--  30805 -->The Retail Tax Extract incorrectly returned a 0% rate when you selected Business Locations and Product Classes as your extract  criteria. This has  been corrected in this release. You can successfully perform a Retail Tax Extract using any or all of the extract criteria, such as Taxpayer, Business Locations, and Product Classes.</li>
          
          <li>Five new Retail Tax Extract templates have been added, including:
            <ul>

            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<li><!--  31744 -->The Tax Journal Purge screen has been revised to purge records posted before the present date (Today).  It had previously been purging records posted up to and including the present date.  Since the purge is based on the date a record is posted, rather than on the date a record is exported, the phrase "Purge data exported prior to:" has been changed to  "Purge data posted prior to:".</li>

</ol>

<h3>Changes in 6.0 SR3.1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <!--  29448 -->

  <li>
    <!--  29651 -->
    An issue where Retail Tax Extract (RTE) did not completely populate the RTE tables due to some U.S. Max Tax rules generating two line item tax details has been resolved.  The Retail Tax Extract now completes successfully with no log errors, and excludes the Max Tax Line Item from the Retail Tax Extract XML. This impacts only users who licensed Vertex Retail and use the RTE deployment model.</li>
  <li><!--  29473 -->In Standard Reports, an issue where the Returns Export Location report did not generate correctly when running O Series on a UNIX-based system has been resolved.</li>

Refer to the <span class="Emphasis">Vertex
Indirect Tax for Retail Installation and Administration Guide</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Vertex Retail Tax Extract Integration Guide</span> for details.</li>
    <li>In Vertex Central, Data Management has been updated to include Tax Engine Extract, Retail Tax Extract, and Import Service. Refer to the Data Management section of <span class="Emphasis">Vertex Central Help</span> for more information about these features.</li>
    <li>A new feature, Bracket Management, has been added to the System menu. This enables management of bracket schedules for use in point-of-sale tax lookups. Refer to the new Bracket Management section of <span class="Emphasis">Vertex Central Help</span> for more information.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>The Batch Client Interface (BCI) has been enhanced to accept a database table as its input source as an alternative to using CSV files. Refer to the <span class="Emphasis">BCI Integration Guide </span>for more information.</li>

  <li><!--  28723 -->An issue where Exemption Certificate Customer Contact information was unavailable to the letter batch creation process and causing errors in the letters has been resolved. </li>

  <li><!--  18227 -->For users who process a high volume of transactions using multiple Tax Journal Export activities, the Summary Data Update feature provides a means to reduce total processing time.  Summary data can also be updated when exporting the Tax Journal to the Reporting database.</li>

  <li><!--  1006976/17679 -->The State-by-State Taxability report has been enhanced to function in countries outside the US.</li>

  <li><!--  992188/16982 -->Logic has been added for child taxpayers to adopt the registration setup information of the parent taxpayer only if the child taxpayer is not a filing entity.</li>
  
  <li><!--  988034/17663 -->All bracket tax schedules now apply at the invoice level - that is, on combined taxable amounts from all line items on the invoice.</li>
  
  <li><!--  1052396/17173 -->Performance when doing broad searches (for example, a search for many customers) has been improved.</li>

  <li>Rate Lookup changes: </li>
  <ul>
    <li><!--  1021784/17074 -->An issue where incorrect US Sales Tax Holiday special rates were being returned has been resolved.</li>

  <li><!--1004880-->Tax Assist has been enhanced with three new fields to provide more information  about the buyer in value added tax transactions:
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>buyer.taxRegistration.hasPhysicalPresenceInd</strong> field indicates whether or not the buyer has a physical presence in the country represented by the registration.</li>
      <li>The <strong>buyer.taxRegistration.isoCountryCode</strong> is a two-character or three-character alphabetic International Standards Organization (ISO) code indicating 
      the country represented by the registration. For a list of countries and their ISO codes, refer to Country Names in the Supporting Information section in the XML Integration Guide or Java Integration Guide.</li>

  <li>Calculation Engine changes:
    <ul>      
      <li><!--  18218 -->A new checkbox, Include New Impositions, enables users to control whether all new impositions added in a Vertex monthly data update are automatically activated or deactivated.  This new check box is available for taxpayers, customers, vendors, and certificates.  This checkbox is checked by default, automatically applying new impositions as part of calculations (as was the case in previous O Series releases).</li>
      <li><!--  1007860 -->An issue where exemption certificates set up in the US state of California at the county level were incorrectly setting the district level as taxable has been resolved.</li>
      <li><!--  1006998/17680 -->The Calculation Engine has been revised to no longer apply country level basis rules for an imposition of a different type at lower-level jurisdictions. For Basis tax rules, the new Tax Type field enables users to specify tax type as a qualifying condition.</li>

      <li><!--  15691 -->An issue where the Rate Classification was not always returned in cases where it was set through other than a tax rule has been resolved.</li>
      <li><!--  993790/16986 -->Rounding logic has been updated to exclude exact calculations of tax from rounding adjustment. An exact calculation is one where the precision of a result does not exceed that of the currency used in the calculation. For example, a calculation of tax of $6.025 would not be considered an exact calculation since the precision of the US Dollar is only two digits. </li>
      <li><!-- 17131 -->An issue where basis amounts in a tax-inclusive processing scenario are incorrectly adjusted, resulting in incorrect taxable amounts, has been resolved.</li>
      <li><!-- 1052346/17198 -->An issue where a tax adjustment due to rounding caused the tax to exceed the taxable amount has been corrected.</li>
      <li><!-- 17143 -->Shipped items having a negative value are considered credits. If an apportionment rule applies to the associated transaction, other negative line items on the transaction provide the basis for allocating the freight charge.</li>
      <li><!-- 974752/17144 -->Adjustment of two taxable tax details through apportionment processing resulted in  two non-taxable details being incorrectly set equal to the basis amount, causing the non-taxable amounts to be doubled. This has been corrected.</li>
      <li><!-- 17148 -->An issue where calculations with a Deferred Tax Result were setting the filing taxable   amount incorrectly has been resolved.</li>
      <li><!-- 1062232/17216 -->Value Added Tax is now calculated for the Corsica region of France without a location error being displayed.</li>
      <li><!-- 17148 -->The Brazil final substitution tax value now correctly calculates in instances where the ICMS Reseller amount is greater than the Substitution Tax amount.  In such cases, the Tax Amount is now set to "0".</li>
      <li><!-- 1083876/28046 -->An issue where Distribute tax transactions in a Jurisdiction with freight charges and a U.S. Max Tax rule were being calculated incorrectly has been resolved.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><!--  988284 -->In Taxability Manager Data Export, an issue where attaching a note to category mappings caused data export to fail has been resolved.</li>
  <li><!--1037120-->Apportionment logic has been updated with a new option, Trigger, that allows freight charges to be nontaxable if associated with line items that are all nontaxable, but fully taxable if at least one of the associated line items is taxable.</li>
  <li><!-- 1064330 -->An issue where lower-level registration information generated for a jurisdiction was not being cleared from the GUI display before the display was repopulated with different information has been resolved.</li>
  <li><!-- 16832/969144 -->Business Locations associated with expired Tax Area IDs (TAID) are no longer displayed.</li>

      <li><!-- 1097222/27818 -->Mapping to a Taxability Category based on one driver is now always ignored when a mapping based on a combination of the same driver and a second driver has been applied. This fixes an infrequent problem that was preventing a user from overriding an exempt usage  category (Manufacturing) by a more specific combination of drivers.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><!-- 1030516/17103 -->An issue where the View Filter Detail page was not displaying the correct filter has been resolved.</li>
  <li><!-- 1035710/17124 -->
   The Tax Rule View screen now correctly populates the Reason Code field and correctly displays the Is Standard checkbox.</li>
  <li>Taxability Driver changes:
    <ul>
      <li><!-- 1032654/17111 -->Creating a taxability driver identical to an existing driver with the same start date now produces an error.</li>
      
      <li><!-- 1100634/28268 -->Taxability Driver records having the same code or name,  but  associated to different perspectives and  not sharing business events, can now be imported.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><!-- 1033062/17113 -->Results of batch testing in Transaction Tester are retained until the user logs off.</li>
  <li><!-- 969042/17138 -->When performing calculations in Brazil and India in which multiple impositions (Service Tax, Secondary and Higher Education Cess, Education CESS, Central Excise Tax, and VAT) are evaluated and a NO TAX conclusion results, O Series now consistently returns the VAT imposition.</li>
  <li><!-- 969042/17178 -->An issue where modifying registrations changes the registrations back as far as the start date of the taxpayer without regard to the as of date, has been resolved.</li>
  <li><!-- 18254 -->Users can now start multiple retail extract jobs.  The jobs are processed serially.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Changes in 6.0</h3>
<ol>
  
  <li><!--645742, 491532-->The new Vertex O Series licensing structure makes it easier for users to license only those capabilities that their business operations require. License either the Supplies (sales) business events, Procurement (purchases) events, or both, along with the requisite regional data set to meet your requirements. Additional optional capabilities include:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Retail license supports the specialized point-of-sale processing needs of the retail industry.</li>
      <li> Leasing license provides a special data set to meet the unique taxation needs of leasing transactions.</li>
      <li> Vertex&reg; Address Cleansing license provides access to an address cleansing service that returns ZIP+4 information for U.S. addresses.</li>
      <li>Newly-enhanced Vertex Reporting and Analysis license provides the flexible reporting capabilities of Cognos Business Intelligence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><!--544764-->Vertex Exemption Certificate Manager (ECM) is now integrated into the Vertex O Series version 6.0 platform. ECM automates the collection, validation, and maintenance of tax exemption certificates for North American jurisdictions. Capabilities include:

      <li>Searchable auditor reporting and certificate export</li>
      <li>Correspondence management</li>
      <li><!--541426-->Migration tool for users of ECM v3.x to move their data to Vertex O Series v6.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Vertex ECM solution manages certificates, provides compliance reporting, and supports auditing requirements that aid in the avoidance of costly penalties as well as regulation compliance.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Vertex O Series version 6.0 features a completely redesigned user interface based on Adobe Flex. Using Flex provides the a more attractive, easy-to-use global user interface with selected workflow improvements. Significant changes in the Vertex Central graphical user interface include: </li>
  <ul>
    <li><!--491532-->Separate features for Sales Tax, Consumer Use Tax, and Value Added Tax have been consolidated into a single Indirect Tax user interface. Users will now select from one of two business events (Supplies or Procurement). Vertex Central features permissions have been reorganized to reflect Supplies and Procurement business events. Those permissions that are shared by both business events are under System. </li>
    <li><!--802292-->The interface for Tax Assist has been modified to take advantage of the new Adobe Flex user interface technology. As a result, a significant amount of new functionality has been introduced, including enhanced editing flexibility and a new drag and drop feature, which simplifies the building of rules. In addition there is a new tax allocation feature which provides an easier method for the user to create and maintain child line items.</li>
    <li>When multiple regions are licensed, Vertex O Series now allows for the sharing of taxability drivers providing for more efficient product mapping.</li>
    <li>Vertex O Series has a new Preferences feature. Preferences are the specific system settings within Vertex O Series that enable you to customize the values presented for locales (geographic regions), currency rate, transaction types, certificates, taxability, and jurisdictions.</li>
  </ul>

  <li><!--5288-->The Vertex Central graphic user interface is now supported on Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox.</li>
  <li><!--858702-->Vertex O Series data has been consolidated into two files: Standard (VertexOSeries) and/or Leasing (VertexOSeriesLease) data files. These data files apply to full, delta, and interim updates. Vertex O Series version 6.0 users operating in a global environment benefit from the streamlined maintenance provided by consolidated monthly data files, making it easier to stay current with the latest rates and rule changes.  </li>
  <li>The About page  is now a printable PDF file.</li>
 
  <li><!--606108 -->In Reporting, the customer name field has been added to the Exemption Certificate report.</li>

 
  <li>Tax calculation and compliance changes in version 6.0 include:
    <ul>
      <li><!--633304-->Handling of gift cards and gift certificates has been enhanced. As taxes are incurred on the purchases made with these cards, the taxes when purchasing these cards are deferred. Logic to handle this type of transaction processing has been added to the Calculation Engine.</li>
      <li><!--584306, 584306-->
      Processing for transactions in Canada has been enhanced, including full country level Goods and Services Tax (GST) support and recoverability. Vertex O Series now charges a single tax with the national and provincial components broken out including the HST (Harmonized Sales Tax), PST (Provincial Sales Tax) or QST (Quebec Sales Tax).</li>
      <li><!--638690-->You can now use Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) jurisdiction codes as required by the Brazilian government for compliance reporting purposes. IBGE is the agency responsible for statistical, geographic, cartographic, geodetic, and environmental information in Brazil. IBGE has established a coding system that identifies different municipalities within Brazil to help gather this information. Identification of these jurisdiction codes is required for compliance reporting purposes. If your Vertex O Series regional license includes Brazil, Vertex O Series version 6.0  now supplies these IBGE codes and provides this capability via look-up functionality.</li>
      <li>Vertex O Series version 6.0 users benefit from a newly-incorporated reverse charge mechanism for imports. When a company receives imports into certain jurisdictions, O Series calculates Import VAT, applies a reverse charge, and in turn indicates that the tax was of type input/output.</li>
      <li><!--836594 -->The Calculation Engine now accepts a physical presence indicator for each location specified within a transaction.</li>
      
      <li><!--836584 -->The Calculation Engine now accepts multiple nexus indicators to specify different jurisdiction levels.</li>
      <li><!--751152 -->The Tax Area ID lookup now has two lines for addresses, each 100 characters maximum length.</li>

      <li>O Series now allows the user to applies a tax surcharge per unit quantity of an item.</li>
      <li><!--174064 --> Users can now assign a Reason Code to the Nontaxable or Exempt portion of a U.S. Max Tax rule.</li>
      <li><!--237276 -->Vertex Exemption Certificate Manager permits users to select multiple states for the same certificate.</li>
            
      <li><!--847102, 827700 -->When calculating the recoverability of negative tax amounts, O Series now correctly stores the recoverable amount as a negative number.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   <li>Taxability Mapping Enhancements:
    <ul>
      <li><!--577696-->The jurisdiction selector now shows a 'D' for deferred taxability in those cases where a lower level jurisdiction defers to a higher level jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
 
  <li>Vertex has added support for the following platforms with O Series for version 6.0:
    <ul>
      <li>Application servers: JBoss 5.1, WebLogic Server 11gR1 (10.3.1)</li>
      <li>Database servers: IBM DB2 UDB Version 9.7 (for Windows, UNIX, or Linux)</li>
      <li>Operating systems: Windows 7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vertex has retired support for the following platforms with O Series for version 6.0:
    <ul>
      <li>Application servers: JBoss 4.0.2, Tomcat 5.5, WebLogic 9.2</li>
      <li>Database servers: IBM DB2 8.2, Oracle 9.2, Oracle 10.1, SQL Server 2000</li>
      <li><!--639060 -->Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <li>In the Vertex Configuration file, the taxgis.jurisdictionfninder.ToUseVertexCompressionLogic parameter has been deprecated. Use the following parameters instead:
      <ul>
        <li>taxgis.jurisdictionfninder.ToUseVertexCompressionLogicCity</li>
        <li>taxgis.jurisdictionfninder.ToUseVertexCompressionLogicCountry</li>
        <li>taxgis.jurisdictionfninder.ToUseVertexCompressionLogicMainDivision</li>
        <li>taxgis.jurisdictionfninder.ToUseVertexCompressionLogic SubDivision</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

<h2><a name="Known" id="Known"></a>Known issues</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
  <li><!-- 268980 -->DB2 tablespace names must not contain a dash. DB2 jdbc drivers will not correctly parse database 
  table create statements with a dash in the tablespace name, and the Vertex O Series installation will fail.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Servlet container</h3>
<ul><li><!--No defect # -->Vertex recommends using the JAXP 1.2 XML parser from Sun, which is provided
      with the  Vertex Web applications. If your servlet container follows section
      SRV.9.7.2 of the Java Servlet Specification, then it uses JAXP 1.2. Note that some servlet
      containers  may intercept the JAXP 1.2 XML parser. If this is the case with
      your servlet container, refer to the documentation for your servlet container for details on configuring
      the Vertex-supplied XML parser so that it functions properly in this environment.
      Also, refer to the <em>Installation Guide</em> for information on preparing the servlet
  container.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Integrations</h3>

<ul>
    <li><!-- No defect # -->If you are planning to perform transactions that involve the conversion of one currency to another you must set up the interface between your Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and Vertex O Series to pass Vertex conversion rates and currency codes for the locations in the transaction.  The locations may be any or all of the following that are applicable in your situation:
      <ul>
        <li> Physical Origin (PO)</li>
      
    <li>Administrative Origin (AO) </li>
      <li> Administrative Destination (AD)</li>
      <li> Destination (D)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
    <!-- No defect # -->
  For performance reasons, objects returned by the API may reference objects used internally by 
        the system.  Mutable objects returned by the API should not be modified because modifying internal attributes 
can cause unpredictable results. Examples of mutable objects returned by the API are java.util.Date and Java arrays.    </li>
</ul>

<h3>WebLogic</h3>

The following issues exist in deployments that use selected versions of WebLogic:
<ul>
<li>In deployments that use WebLogic 10.3.3, 10.3.4, 10.3.5, or 10.3.6 with AIX 6 or 7 and Address Cleansing, the normal EAR deployment for O Series SR4 and later does not work properly. The following workaround makes O Series function properly, but disables Address Cleansing. To implement the workaround, follow these steps:</li>
<ol>
<li>Edit the WAR file to remove the metro jar files webservices*.jar.</li>
<li>Remove the weblogic.xml file from the WEB-INF folder.</li>
<li>Repackage and deploy the WAR file.</li>
</ol>
<li>In deployments that use WebLogic 10.3.6 with Windows, the normal EAR deployment for O Series SR4 and later does not work properly. There is no workaround. WebLogic 10.3.5 and earlier work with Windows.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Certificates</h3>

<ul>
  <li><!-- 39483 -->When doing a certificate search by Imposition, the search only displays impositions that are not checked </li>


</ul>
<h3>Vertex Central - General</h3>
<ul>
  <li><!-- WDM3376 -->
  Use the Vertex Central interface for navigation, not  the buttons of your browser.</li>
  <li><!--no defect #-->Depending on the display resolution of your monitor and the toolbar settings of your browser, some parts of the Vertex Central window may not display. For best results, view the browser window in full screen mode by selecting <span class="Strong">View &gt; Full Screen</span> from the browser's main menu or by pressing <strong>F11</strong>.</li>
  <li><!-- 480766 -->If you plan to log in to Vertex Central on more than one browser window on the same computer (for example,
    to log in to multiple partitions at the same time), you must open a new browser instance for each login. If you open
  a new browser window from within the current browser window, you may experience unexpected results.</li>
  <li><!-- 68956, 3958 -->Avoid using an apostrophe ('), pipe character (|), or tilde (~)
  as naming conventions in Vertex Central.</li>   
</ul>

<h3>Vertex Central - My Enterprise</h3>

<ul>
<li><!-- 291420 -->You can set broad taxability configuration options for taxpayers, customers, and vendors:
      <ul>
      <li>Taxpayers can be set as Generally Taxable, 100% Exempt, or Products are Generally Nontaxable.</li>
      <li>Customers and vendors can be set as Generally Taxable or 100% Exempt.</li>
    </ul>
    Historical values for these settings are not maintained in the data. If you change one of these settings, the new setting 
  will apply for that party for all transactions (both future and historical credit transactions).  </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Vertex Central - Tax Setup </h3>
<ul>
<li>The Tax Assist attribute, calculateVendorTaxIndicator, does not calculate tax from both the seller   and buyer perspectives for a Purchase Order request message, as specified. To calculate this tax, use one of the following methods:</li>
<ul>
<li>In Vertex Central, use Taxability Mapping to map the taxpayer to the <span class="Code">Qualifying Conditions &gt; Special Taxability Drivers > Consumer Use Tax Accrual Indicator</span> taxability category.</li>
<li>In the XML, pass <span class="Code">calculateVendorTaxIndicator=true</span> in the Invoice line.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Vertex Central - Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li><!-- 59634 -->When loading a transaction  in Transaction Tester that has the multicomponent indicator set on a line item,  the <strong>Multicomponent</strong> check box does  not populate. Select this check box before running the transaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Install" id="Install"></a>Installation notes</h2>
<p class="style1">If you are installing Vertex O Series for the first time, refer to the instructions in the <span class="Emphasis">Installation Guide</span> to install Vertex O Series 6.0, and then follow the instructions below to apply this Service Release.  Applying this Service Release installs files on your system. Do not remove these files. </p>
<p class="Note">Vertex O Series Service Releases are cumulative.  For example, if you are on O Series v6.0 and apply the v6.0 SR3 patch, you will install all the changes made in v6.0 SR1 through v6.0 SR3. Should the latest Service Release installation fail, Vertex Support can help you revert easily to your previous version. Do not install several Service Releases one after the other at one time or you will have to back out each Service Release separately to revert to your previous version</p>

<h3>Applying  6.0 SR7.7</h3>
<h4>Before you begin</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you have multiple instances of O Series pointing to one database and are applying a patch you <em>must</em> wait until the patch application is completed before applying the patch to the next instance. For example, you may have multiple instances of O Series for load balancing.</li>
  <li>Review the <em>Installation Guide</em> chapter titled &quot;Deploying Your Servlet Container&quot; as well as the pre- and post- installation chapters for any notes or special instructions related to your particular Web application server.</li>
  <li>If you plan to deploy O Series using Oracle WebLogic, you <span class="Emphasis">must</span> deploy the O Series <span class="Code">.ear</span> files, not the <span class="Code">.war</span> files.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have the correct Vertex O Series License file, and that it is copied into the Vertex Home directory.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the Web Archive (WAR) and Enterprise Archive (EAR) files for the O Series components are in your Web directory. If these files were moved, the service release may not install correctly. </li>
  <li>Ensure that your application server user account and the user account used to install this service release have full read, write, create, and delete access to the Vertex Home directory and all subdirectories. </li>
  <li>If you have purchased Vertex Reporting and Analysis, ensure that your database user ID has permission to create a database view. </li>
  <li>Vertex recommends that you turn off schema validation before applying a Service Release. </li>
  <li>Vertex recommends that you back up all O Series databases before applying a Service Release. To ensure the integrity of the system, you should always back up all O Series databases at the same time. If you need to restore any one database, you must restore all the databases. </li>
  <li>
    <!-- 743250 -->
    If you are applying this Service Release to a system running the AIX 6.1 Operating System, be sure to perform the installation of the Service Release as a user in the root group.</li>
</ul>
<h4>To apply this Service Release</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the JAR file for the service release (vertex-o-series-patch-6.0.7.7.1.jar) to the patch directory located under the <em>Vertex Home</em> directory, which is the root directory in which TPS is installed. </li>
  <li>Change the working directory to the patch directory. </li>
  <li>Stop the application server. </li>
  <li>Undeploy the Web applications. </li>
